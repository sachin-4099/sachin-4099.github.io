The results of **[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/4831132022996992/#5816442299088896)** were out on 04 May 2020 and I am pleased to share that my proposal with **[Sympy](http://sympy.org)** was accepted. I will be working on my project, [Amendments to Limit Evaluation and Series Expansion](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OgbnWLzQzaLfmmSM-fK09TCJmUzJ6tq4/view?usp=sharing), during a period of 3 months spanning from June to August. I am really excited to work for such an amazing organization. I would like to thank all the members of the organisation especially [Kalevi Suominen](https://github.com/jksuom) for guiding me in my proposal and PR's.


The first phase is the _Community Bonding Period_, which has nearly come to an end. In this period I mainly focussed on the following things.


 - Setting up blog and synchronizing it with planet sympy.

 - Discussing possible means of communication etc.

 - Planning the implementation of some of the features of the project with Kalevi.

 - Familiarizing with the codebase of `sympy/combinatorics` and see how it may help solving the problems while implementing the project.

 - Getting more in-depth theoretical knowledge of the features to be implemented.


Looking forward for a really productive and wonderful summer ahead.
