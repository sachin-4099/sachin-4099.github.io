Key `highlights` of this weekâ€™s work are:

* **[Adds cdir parameter to handle series expansions on branch cuts](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19555)**   
  * Finally, after spending almost 2 weeks on this, we were able to merge the PR, adding a very important functionality of `series expansions` on the `branch cuts` to the codebase. 
    Previously, either `SymPy` raised some error or the series expansion was computed incorrectly, when the value in the input was on the branch cut. But now, for most of the functions, the expansion produced is correct.
    Not only this, we added the `cdir` parameter to `leadterm` and `as_leading_term` functions as well. We even extended the functionality a bit to the `limits` module, so now, 
    `limits` of values lying on the branch cuts of a function are also computed correctly in most cases.  
    We are planning to extend this functionality to all the remaining `special functions` and wherever else possible to make the codebase as robust as possible.
