The results of **[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/4831132022996992/#5816442299088896)** were out on 04 May 2020 and I am pleased to share with you that my proposal with **[Sympy](http://sympy.org)** was accepted.  
I would like to thank all the members of the organisation especially [Kalevi Suominen](https://github.com/jksuom) for guiding me in my proposal and PR's. I am really excited to work for such an amazing organization. 
I will be working on my project, [Amendments to Limit Evaluation and Series Expansion](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OgbnWLzQzaLfmmSM-fK09TCJmUzJ6tq4/view?usp=sharing), during a period of 3 months spanning from June to August, under the mentorship of [Kalevi Suominen](https://github.com/jksuom) and [Sartaj Singh](https://github.com/leosartaj). My primary focus will be to work on the `series` module and make it more robust as it is the backbone of all the limit evaluations performed by the library.

Looking forward for a really productive and wonderful summer ahead.
