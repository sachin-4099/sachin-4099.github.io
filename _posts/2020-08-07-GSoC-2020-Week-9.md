Key `highlights` of this weekâ€™s work are:

* **[Fixed periodicity of trigonometric function](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19741)**

  * This was a long pending issue. The `_peeloff_pi` method of `sin` had to be rectified to reduce the symbolic multiples of pi in trigonometric functions.
  As a result of this fix, now `sin(2*n*pi + 4)` automatically evaluates to `sin(4)`, when `n` is an `integer`.
<br><br>
* **[Fixed limit evaluations related to trigonometric functions](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19916)**   
  * In this PR, we added `_eval_nseries` method to both `sin` and `cos` to make the limit evaluations more robust when it comes to trigonometric functions
    
    We also added a piece of code to `cos.eval` method so that the `limit of cos(m*x)`, where `m` is `non-zero`, and `x` tends to `oo` evaluates to `AccumBounds(-1, 1)`.
