Key `highlights` of this weekâ€™s work are:

* **[Fixed incorrect limit evaluation related to LambertW function](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19716)**

  * This was a minor bug fix. We added the `_singularities` feature to the `LambertW` function so that its limit gets evaluated using the `meromorphic check` already present in the limit codebase.
<br><br>
* **[Fixed errors in assumptions when rewriting RisingFactorial / FallingFactorial as gamma or factorial](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/18696)**   
  * This was a long pending issue. The rewrite to `gamma` or `factorial` methods of `RisingFactorial` and `FallingFactorial` did not handle all the possible cases, which caused errors in some evaluations.
    Thus, we decided to come up with a proper rewrite using `Piecewise` which accordingly returned the correct rewrite depending on the assumptions on the variables.
    Handling such rewrites using `Piecewise` is never easy, and thus there were a lot of failing testcases.
    After spending a lot of time debugging and fixing each failing testcase, we were finally able to merge this.
    
This marks the end of `Phase-2` of the program. I learnt a lot during these two months and gained many important things from my mentors.
