The first part of my GSoC journey was the Community Bonding Period.

In this period, I mainly focussed on the following things:

- Setting up my blog, where I will provide weekly reports on the progress of my project, and synchronizing it with planet sympy.
- Setting up a public gitter channel for discussions regarding the project.
- Prioritising the issues to be solved.
- Deciding the finer details of the workflow with my mentors and working out efficient ways to solve each particular issue.

Since I have been contributing to SymPy for the past 8-9 months, it was easier for me to blend into the community.  

Now, as everything has gone as planned, I have decided to make a head start and begin with the implementation of my project.
