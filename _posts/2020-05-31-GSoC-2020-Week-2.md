Key `highlights` of this weekâ€™s work are:

* **[Fixed _eval_nseries() of Mul](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19369)**
  
  * This was a long pending issue. 
    Previously, in the codebase the `series expansion of a product` was computed as the `product of expansions of the factors`. 
    This approach was correct only when the `leading term of each series` is a `constant` but not in general.
    
    For example, to compute the expansion of `f(x)/x**10` at `x = 0` to order `O(x**10)` it is necessary to compute the series expansion 
    of the function `f(x)` to order `O(x**20)` and thus, computing till order `O(x**10)` would not suffice.
    
    The strategy we implemented to resolve this issue was:
    - Compute the order `n0` of the `leading term of the product` as the `sum of the orders` of the `leading terms of the factors`.
    - For each factor, compute `n - n0` terms of its series expansion (starting from its `leading term of order n1` and `ending at order n - n0 + n1`).
    - Multiply the expansions (`truncating at terms of order n`).
    
    I enjoyed implementing all this because at every step we had to ensure that we are not compromising with the efficiency of the code. 
    Finally, this issue was resolved and we ended up adding an extremely optimised implementation of the function to the codebase.

* **[Used is_meromorphic() function to speed up limit evaluations](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19432)**
  
  * In this PR, we made use of the `is_meromorphic()` function of SymPy to speed up limit evaluations for certain type of cases.
    
    A function is said to be `meromorphic` at a point, if at that point the `limit of the function exists but is infinite`. 
    In these cases, the value of the limit can usually be determined with the help of the `series expansion of that function` and 
    thus, there is no need to invoke the `Gruntz algorithm`. 
    
    While working on the implementation of this functionality, we required the `leading term` of the `series expansion of the function in the limit expression at the point at which the limit needs to be evaluated`.
    
    But we came across a weird situation, where for some functions, we got `Complex Infinity` as the `leading term`.
    Thus, we had to rectify the `_eval_as_leading_term()` methods of these functions (done in a separate **[PR](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19461)**).
    
    After resolving this issue, we succeeded in adding the required functionality and hence, increased the efficiency of the limit evaluation algorithm of SymPy.
