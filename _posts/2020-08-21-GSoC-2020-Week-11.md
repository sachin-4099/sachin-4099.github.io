Key `highlights` of this weekâ€™s work are:

* **[Fixed limit evaluations related to lowergamma, uppergamma and besselk function](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19990)**

  * We added `_eval_is_meromorphic` method to class `lowergamma` and `uppergamma` so that some of the `limits` involving `lowergamma` and `uppergamma` functions 
    get evaluated using the `meromorphic check` already present in the limit codebase. Now, to make `lowergamma` and `uppergamma` functions `tractable` for limit evaluations, 
    `_eval_aseries` method was added to `lowergamma` and `_eval_rewrite_as_tractable` to `uppergamma`. 
    
    Finally, we also `rectified` the `eval` method of class `besselk`, so that `besselk(0, oo)` automatically evaluates to `0`.
