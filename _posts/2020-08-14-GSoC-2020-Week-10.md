Key `highlights` of this weekâ€™s work are:

* **[Added _eval_is_meromorphic() to bessel function](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19963)**

  * We added the `_eval_is_meromorphic` method to the class `BesselBase` so that some of the limits involving `bessel functions` get evaluated using the `meromorphic check` already present in the limit codebase.
