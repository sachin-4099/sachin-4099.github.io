Key `highlights` of this weekâ€™s work are:

* **[Fixed _eval_nseries() of log](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/20002)**

  * This was a long pending issue. It was necessary to refactor the `_eval_nseries` method of `log` to fix some minor issues.  
    
This marks the end of `Phase-3` of the program.
Finally, this brings us to the end of `Google Summer of Code` and I am really thankful to the `SymPy` Community and my mentor `Kalevi Suominen` for always helping and supporting me.
