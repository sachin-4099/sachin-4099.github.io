Key `highlights` of this weekâ€™s work are:

* **[Fixed RecursionError and Timeout in limit evaluations](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/pull/19646)**

  * The `Recursion Errors` in limit evaluations were mainly due to the fact that the indeterminant form of `1**oo` was not handled accurately in the `mrv()` function of the
    `Gruntz algorithm`. So, some minor changes were required to fix those. 
    
    The major issue was to handle those cases which were timing out. On deep digging, we identified that the 
    `cancel()` function of `polytools.py` was the reason. Thus, we decided to completely transform the `cancel()` function to speed up its algorithm. 
    Now after this major modification, many testcases were failing as the `cancel()` function plays an important role in simplifying evaluations and 
    is thus used at many places across the codebase. Therefore, a lot of time was spent in debugging and rectifying these testcases. 
    
    Finally we were able to merge this, enhancing the limit evaluation capabilities of `SymPy`.
